###Command + R (or Command + P, then type @)

To jump to the symbols (i.e., functions, methods, css properties), so it works well with .js and .css files.

###Combine Command + P, go to file then @ to access properties/

e.g., 
Say there is a class called ```h1``` in your style.css file.

Use fuzzy search,
go
```Command + P``` then type, ```style@h1```.

This will take your direcly to the h1 class of the style.css file without opening file first, and then Command + R.
